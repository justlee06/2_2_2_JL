Description:
This assignment was a lesson in using Backendless to add extra functionality to the CollegeApp.
Team member roles in assignment: Justin - Coded the app and documentation

Key Lessons learned:
Summarize what you think important teaching points from the lesson were.  

Some important teaching points from the lesson was learning what Backend as a Service was and how it helps your applications between more advanced. The lesson teaches how to add the Backendless SDK to your app project, and how to implement it. The lesson also taught how to connect our app to Backendless servers and create users. It also teaches how to save profile data onto the backendless servers, and retrieve them from the servers.

Conclusion Questions
1)  What are the benefits of adding a back end for an application? 

The benefits of adding a back end for an application is that you can share data between different devices by storing data onto a centralized database. This backend database allows app users to access this data as allowed by the developer.

2) What is a Backend as a Service and how does it work? Include as much detail as you can about the infrastructure and implementation.  Include any interesting notes from class presentations.

Backend as a Service is a software development kit that includes APIs that allow software developers to connect their applications to a backend database, such as a cloud storage. The data stored in BaaS is stored in physical servers, and clients are allowed to access this data via the cloud. Using BaaS, you can delete, upload, and add data to your app.
